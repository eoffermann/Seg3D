# Seg3D
A sample Unity project that uses Intel Realsense camera and its Seg3D module. In the latest version of Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2016 R3, there is no unity sample project for any of the algorithm modules. Here is an example project to show how to use User Background Segmentation (Seg3D) and get the highest available resolution for this module which is 1280x720.

I used Unity 5.2.2 and Intel Realsense SR300 for this project. Other requirements can be found on the Intel's website.
